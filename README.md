Purpose
=======
The goal of this program is to use your webcam to prevent your computer from locking. At the moment it's just a silly hack, but it's just details to getting it to something actually useful. Lots of details...

Compiling
=========
You need a bunch of libs. OpenCV + HighGui are the most obvious ones. You also need the dbus glib library (dbus-glib-1) because I'll eventually make the code not horribly hackish and slow by using dbus (atm I call out to qdbus).
